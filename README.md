The max-subarray problem aims at finding out the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum. (Negative numbers included)

The approach used here is that of Divide and Conquer.
The ans may lie in either the left subarray,the right or in the middle(overlapping the middle element).
